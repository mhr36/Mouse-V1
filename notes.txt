Network size up to ~3000 run generate_tuning_curves in very similar times, about 42 seconds with 100 iterations of Euler2fixedpt.

Iterations of Euler2fixedpt have strong impact on efficiency (seems linear as expected) so has been reduced from 500 to 100 for testing.
500 iterations takes around 4 seconds on N=1000 matrix. 22 seconds on N=10000.
100 iterations takes around 1.3 seconds on N=1000.

Issue computing grad, crashes every time, even for small networks.

Only 10% processor is used and no GPU

N=1000: 41 seconds, loss=31.0
N=10000: 380 seconds, loss=6.90
